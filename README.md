## Problem definition
Are we able to extimate how a particular tweet can influence the price of Bitcoin?

## Models Used
Logistic regression

## Conclusion
- Certain components of a tweet affect its influence, which can be positive or negative, based on the original sentiment of the tweet
- Influence has a weak correlation to price
- Bitcoin has many factors affecting its price
- Our project can be improved and expanded upon to fit other context
